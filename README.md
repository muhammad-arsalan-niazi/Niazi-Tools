## 🛠️ Tools Available

Niazi Tools currently offers the following powerful utilities:

### 1. 📋 Copyable Lines
Convert a large block of text into a list of individual lines. Each line can be edited, deleted, or copied with a single click, either marking it as done or removing it from the list. Perfect for working through lists, tasks, or data.

### 2. 📝 Copyable Paragraphs
Similar to Copyable Lines, this tool splits a large text block into individual paragraphs based on blank lines. Each paragraph can be edited, deleted, or copied, making it ideal for working with articles, reports, or long-form content.

### 3. 🔍 Find & Replace
Perform powerful bulk find-and-replace operations on your text. You can add multiple rules for finding and replacing text and apply them all at once.

### 4. 📧 Email Extractor
Quickly scan large amounts of text or upload files (.txt, .csv, .xls, and .xlsx) to find all email addresses, count their occurrences, and list the unique ones.

### 5. 🗺️ Query Generator
Instantly generate a list of search queries for a specific service across all major locations (states, counties, or provinces) of a selected country (UK, USA, or Canada). Perfect for market research or lead generation campaigns.
