## 🛠️ Tools Available

Niazi Tools currently offers the following powerful utilities:

### 1. 📋 Copyable Lines
Convert a large block of text into a list of individual lines. Each line can be edited, deleted, or copied with a single click, either marking it as done or removing it from the list. Perfect for working through lists, tasks, or data.

### 2. 📝 Copyable Paragraphs
Add up to 10 paragraphs manually or upload multiple .txt files in bulk. The tool converts them into a list of distinct, copyable paragraphs, preserving all original formatting. It's ideal for working with articles, reports, or long-form content.

### 3. 🔍 Find & Replace
Perform powerful bulk find-and-replace operations on your text. You can add up to 10 rules for finding and replacing text and apply them all at once.

### 4. 📧 Email Extractor
Quickly scan large amounts of text or upload files (.txt, .csv, .xls, and .xlsx) to find all email addresses, count their occurrences, and list the unique ones. The tool intelligently prioritizes email columns in spreadsheet files.

### 5. 🗺️ Query Generator
Instantly generate a list of search queries for a specific service across all major locations (states, counties, or provinces) of a selected country (UK, USA, or Canada). Perfect for market research or lead generation campaigns.

### 6. ⏰ Time Interval Generator
Create a list of time entries based on a starting time, a fixed interval, and the number of entries you need. Ideal for creating schedules, timetables, or event timelines. You can generate thousands of entries and download them as a .txt file.

### 7. 🔁 Line Repeater
Quickly generate a large number of repeated lines from a single piece of text. Perfect for creating test data, bulk lists, or any scenario where you need to duplicate a line many times. It supports downloading for very large lists.
